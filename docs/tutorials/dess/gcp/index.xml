      <description>Now since I am new to GCP the easiest way to start using it is with prebuild solutions. This way you will deploy small system which is more then capable of handling dess at pre-set price.
We can use pre-build ‚ÄúUbuntu 20‚Äù. In Search bar look for Ubuntu20
üî¥ Make sure to use ‚ÄúUbuntu 20‚Äù and not ‚ÄúHardened Ubuntu 20‚Äù. Although the Hardened version will work as well it requires additional manual steps to make work.</description>

GCP assigned ephemeral IP address to our newly created VM. We need to change it to static IP.
In search bar look for External IP addresses.

      <description>At this step you should already have your @sign registered at atsign.com. If not go do it!
I have registered my own free @sign (@44likelycanary) which I will link to my dess.
In your instance console, navigate to dess folder. If you were following this guide it will be located in:
We now need to create the service that will host our @sign by executing the dess-create command:
$ sudo dess-create @44likelycanary 4atsign.</description>
